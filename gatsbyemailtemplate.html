                            A nickel is worth more than a dime ⁉
                        </h1>
            
                        <p>
                            <span>On March 7th and 8th, Nickel prices surged 174% leading the London Metal Exchange to stop trading for the remainder of the week.</span> Russia produces 11% of global nickel ore production and the sanctions likely had an effect.  Nickel is also a key material in the production of lithium batteries, the same batteries powering electric cars.  For some economies, like Indonesia who is the world’s largest nickel producer, this could be a good thing, but for many others this simply adds to inflation.  In China, Tesla (TSLA) raised prices of their Model 3 and Model Y electric cars.  Could the rise in nickel prices have caused this price hike? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Not everyone will have an easy time raising prices.  </span> Tesla competitor Rivian Automotive (RIVN) raised prices earlier this month, including prices on those who had ordered their cars previously, and saw a staggering rise in customer cancellations.  CEO RJ Scaringe was quick to backtrack and issued a letter offering to honor the original price on pre-orders.  The bad news didn’t end there.  On Thursday afternoon, the company reported earnings that not only missed sales and earnings expectations but also guided that 2022 production would be 25k vehicles, which is half the amount expected.  Management blamed supply chain disruptions, which may explain it but didn’t excuse it.  The stock dropped 7.56% on Friday closing at an all-time low of $38.05.  Are the companies you invest in able to handle these changing times?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>On Thursday morning Amazon (AMZN) announced a stock split and a $10B buyback program.  </span> A stock split allows a company to break each existing share into multiple new shares without affecting its total company value.  AMZN board members approved a 20 for 1 stock split effective June 6th.  This means if you own 100 shares prior to June 6, you will own 2000 shares on the morning of June 6th. Note that while the share price will adjust, the value of your investment will not.  Still confused?  Imagine a pizza is worth $10, if you cut it in half, the pizza is still worth $10 and is still worth $10 no matter how many slices you cut.  Each slice will be appropriately priced to add up to $10.  Will the split encourage you to buy a slice of Amazon?
                        </p>
